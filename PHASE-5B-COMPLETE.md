# Phase 5B - Video Delete & Reorder - COMPLETE ✅

## Implementation Summary

Successfully added delete and drag & drop reorder functionality to the video management system in EditEvent.tsx.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Delete Videos ✅
- **Trash Icon Button**: Red circular button with trash icon appears on hover (top-right corner)
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Modal asks "Delete Video?" before deletion
- **Database Deletion**: Removes video from `event_videos` table
- **UI Update**: Video count updates automatically
- **Success Message**: "Video deleted successfully!" shows for 2 seconds
- **Error Handling**: Shows error if deletion fails

### 2. Drag & Drop Reorder ✅
- **Draggable Videos**: All videos can be dragged
- **Grip Icon**: GripVertical icon appears on hover (top-left corner)
- **Visual Feedback**: 50% opacity while dragging
- **Database Update**: Updates `display_order` for all affected videos
- **Success Message**: "Videos reordered!" shows for 2 seconds
- **Error Handling**: Reverts to original order if database update fails

### 3. UI Enhancements ✅
- **Header Updated**: "Added Videos (drag to reorder)" text
- **Hover Overlay**: Shows grip icon (left) and delete button (right)
- **Cursor Changes**: cursor-move indicates draggable items
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches photo management UI patterns
- **White Text with Drop Shadow**: Icons visible on dark thumbnails

## State Variables Added
```typescript
const [draggedVideoId, setDraggedVideoId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [showDeleteVideoConfirm, setShowDeleteVideoConfirm] = useState(false);
const [videoToDelete, setVideoToDelete] = useState<EventVideo | null>(null);
```

## Handlers Added
1. `handleVideoDragStart(videoId)` - Sets dragged video ID
2. `handleVideoDragOver(e)` - Prevents default to allow drop
3. `handleVideoDrop(e, targetVideoId)` - Reorders videos and updates database
4. `handleDeleteVideo()` - Deletes video from database and updates UI
