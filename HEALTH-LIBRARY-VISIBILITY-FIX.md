# Health Library Visibility Fix

## Summary
Fixed the Health Library toggle functionality to properly hide/show the "Health Library" menu item in public navigation and footer.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ModernThemeContext (`src/contexts/ModernThemeContext.tsx`)
- Added `healthLibraryEnabled` state
- Loads `health_library_enabled` from `modern_site_settings` table
- Polls for changes every 60 seconds (same as theme updates)
- Exposes value through context API

### 2. useModernTheme Hook (`src/hooks/useModernTheme.tsx`)
- Exports `healthLibraryEnabled` boolean
- Available to all components that use the hook

### 3. PublicNav Component (`src/components/PublicNav.tsx`)
- Reads `healthLibraryEnabled` from theme context
- Filters out "Health Library" link when disabled
- Works for both desktop and mobile navigation

### 4. PublicFooter Component (`src/components/PublicFooter.tsx`)
- Reads `healthLibraryEnabled` from theme context
- Filters out "Health Library" link when disabled
- Consistent with navigation behavior

## How It Works

**When Health Library is ENABLED (toggle is ON):**
- ✅ "Health Library" appears in public navigation bar
- ✅ "Health Library" appears in footer quick links
- ✅ Users can access `/health-library` page

**When Health Library is DISABLED (toggle is OFF):**
- ❌ "Health Library" hidden from public navigation bar
- ❌ "Health Library" hidden from footer quick links
- ⚠️ Direct URL access still works (page not protected)

## Database Requirement

**IMPORTANT:** The `health_library_enabled` column must exist in `modern_site_settings` table.

If you haven't run the migration yet:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ztfrjlmkemqjbclaeqfw/sql
2. Run the SQL from `APPLY-MIGRATION-NOW.md`
3. Verify with: `node verify-health-library-column.js`

## Testing

1. **Login to Admin Panel**
2. **Go to: Admin > Health Library (Manage Illnesses)**
3. **Toggle "Public Visibility" ON/OFF**
4. **Open public site in new tab/incognito**
5. **Check navigation bar and footer**

Expected behavior:
- Toggle ON → "Health Library" link appears
- Toggle OFF → "Health Library" link disappears
- Changes apply within 60 seconds (theme polling interval)
- Hard refresh immediately applies changes

## Admin Sidebar (Not Affected)

The admin sidebar still shows "Health Library" and "Library Categories" regardless of the public visibility toggle. This is intentional - admins always need access to manage content.

## Real-time Updates

- The theme context polls for changes every 60 seconds
- When `health_library_enabled` changes in database, it updates automatically
- Page refresh immediately reflects changes
- No manual cache clearing needed

## Files Modified

1. `src/contexts/ModernThemeContext.tsx` - Added health library state management
2. `src/hooks/useModernTheme.tsx` - Export health library enabled flag
3. `src/components/PublicNav.tsx` - Filter navigation links
4. `src/components/PublicFooter.tsx` - Filter footer links

## Build Status

✅ Project builds successfully with no errors
✅ TypeScript types are correct
✅ All components compile
