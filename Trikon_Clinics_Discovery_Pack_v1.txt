oor user experience)
   Likelihood: Low
   Mitigation:
   - Implement Next.js image optimization
   - Use ISR for static-like pages
   - Conduct load testing before launch
   - Set up performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
   - Have rollback plan ready

6. RLS POLICY GAPS
   Risk: Sensitive data exposed due to missing policies
   Impact: High (security breach)
   Likelihood: Medium
   Mitigation:
   - Review all RLS policies with security checklist
   - Test with different user roles
   - Enable RLS on ALL tables by default
   - Conduct security audit before launch
   - Monitor activity logs for suspicious access

7. FORM SPAM
   Risk: Contact/appointment forms overwhelmed with spam
   Impact: Medium (lost legitimate inquiries)
   Likelihood: High
   Mitigation:
   - Implement rate limiting (5 submissions per IP per minute)
   - Add honeypot fields to forms
   - Consider Cloudflare Turnstile (privacy-friendly CAPTCHA)
   - Enable email notifications for new submissions
   - Implement spam detection rules

8. MEDIA STORAGE OVERFLOW
   Risk: Supabase storage limits exceeded
   Impact: Medium (cannot upload new images)
   Likelihood: Low
   Mitigation:
   - Implement image compression before upload
   - Set file size limits (10 MB max)
   - Create automated cleanup for old renditions
   - Monitor storage usage dashboard
   - Configure alerts at 80% capacity

9. CONCURRENT EDITING CONFLICTS
   Risk: Multiple admins editing same content simultaneously
   Impact: Low (overwrite each other's changes)
   Likelihood: Medium
   Mitigation:
   - Implement optimistic locking with version numbers
   - Show "currently editing" indicator
   - Auto-save drafts every 30 seconds
   - Provide conflict resolution UI
   - Log all edits in activity log

10. THIRD-PARTY SERVICE DOWNTIME
    Risk: Google Fonts, analytics, or other CDN services down
    Impact: Low (minor visual/tracking issues)
    Likelihood: Low
    Mitigation:
    - Implement font loading strategy (swap)
    - Self-host critical fonts as fallback
    - Make analytics scripts async/defer
    - Test site functionality without third-party services
    - Document fallback procedures

================================================================================
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Before proceeding with implementation, I need clarification on:

1. NEXT.JS MIGRATION: Do you want to migrate from Vite/React to Next.js for 
   better SEO and performance, or continue with Vite? 
   (Recommendation: Next.js for this type of public website)

2. RICH TEXT STORAGE: Should we store health library content (symptoms, 
   treatment) as HTML or structured JSON? 
   (Recommendation: HTML with DOMPurify sanitization for flexibility)

3. THEME PRIORITY: Should we complete the new CMS (pages, templates, 
   components) first, or focus on missing public pages (locations, departments, 
   packages)? 
   (Recommendation: Public pages first, then CMS)


================================================================================
OVERALL APPROACH & BENEFITS

2. Add missing public-facing content types (Locations, Departments, Packages, 
   FAQs, Blog, Gallery)
3. Build new CMS foundation (Pages, Templates, Components, Forms)
4. Enhance with better SEO, performance, and admin UX
5. Migrate incrementally to minimize risk
