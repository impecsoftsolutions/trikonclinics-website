# Events System Migration - Instructions

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Migrations have been prepared and are ready to apply**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Manual step required: SQL execution in Supabase Dashboard**

## Why Manual Execution is Needed

The Supabase JavaScript client (using the Service Role Key) cannot execute DDL (Data Definition Language) statements like `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE POLICY`, etc. This is a security feature of Supabase. To apply migrations, we need to use either:

1. **Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor** (RECOMMENDED - easiest)
2. Supabase CLI with database password
3. Direct PostgreSQL connection with database password

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard

Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ztfrjlmkemqjbclaeqfw/sql/new

### Step 2: Copy and Execute SQL

Open the file: `APPLY-EVENTS-MIGRATIONS.sql`

Copy the ENTIRE contents and paste into the SQL Editor, then click **RUN**.

### Step 3: Seed Test Data

After the SQL executes successfully, run:

```bash
npm run events:seed
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup

```bash
npm run events:verify
```

### Step 5: Run Performance Tests

```bash
npm run events:test
```

## What Gets Created

### Database Tables
- **tags** - Reusable event tags/categories
- **events** - Main events and news articles
- **event_images** - Image gallery for events (3 size variants)
- **event_videos** - YouTube video embeds
- **event_tags** - Many-to-many relationship (events ‚Üî tags)
- **event_error_logs** - Error tracking and debugging

### Feature Flags (in site_settings)
- **events_enabled** - Master switch for events section
- **events_public_access** - Control public vs admin-only access

### Storage
- **events bucket** - Dedicated storage for event images
- Configured with proper RLS policies
- File size limit: 10MB per image
- Allowed: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF

### Security (RLS Policies)
- ‚úÖ All tables have Row Level Security enabled
- ‚úÖ Content Managers can create/edit events
- ‚úÖ Admins can delete events
- ‚úÖ Authenticated users see all events (including drafts)
- ‚úÖ Public users see only published events (when enabled)

### Performance Indexes
- ‚úÖ Optimized for event listing queries
- ‚úÖ Fast slug-based lookups
- ‚úÖ Efficient tag filtering
- ‚úÖ Ordered image/video galleries

## Test Data

The seed script creates:
- 5 predefined tags (Health Camps, Awareness Programs, etc.)
- 3 sample events:
  - 2 published events (visible when public access enabled)
  - 1 draft event (admins only)
- Placeholder images and videos for each event
- Tag associations

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" errors
- Make sure you're logged into the correct Supabase project
- Verify you have admin access to the project

### "Already exists" errors
- These are OK! The migrations are idempotent
- Tables/policies that already exist will not be recreated

### Script execution fails
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE SQL file
- Check for any syntax errors in the SQL Editor
- Try executing one migration at a time if needed

## Alternative: Supabase CLI

If you have Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
# Login to Supabase
npx supabase login

# Link to your project
npx supabase link --project-ref ztfrjlmkemqjbclaeqfw

# Push migrations
npx supabase db push
```

## After Migrations are Applied

1. ‚úÖ Run seed script: `npm run events:seed`
2. ‚úÖ Run verification: `npm run events:verify`
3. ‚úÖ Run performance tests: `npm run events:test`
4. üéâ Events system is ready for Phase 1 (Admin UI development)
