# Quick Start: Fix Health Library Error

## The Problem
```
Error: column modern_site_settings.health_library_enabled does not exist
```

## The Fix (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
ðŸ”— https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ztfrjlmkemqjbclaeqfw/sql

### Step 2: Run This SQL
```sql
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
    WHERE table_name = 'modern_site_settings' AND column_name = 'health_library_enabled'
  ) THEN
    ALTER TABLE modern_site_settings
    ADD COLUMN health_library_enabled boolean DEFAULT true NOT NULL;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Column added successfully';
  END IF;

  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM modern_site_settings LIMIT 1) THEN
    INSERT INTO modern_site_settings (health_library_enabled) VALUES (true);
  END IF;
END $$;
```

### Step 3: Verify It Worked
```bash
node verify-health-library-column.js
```

## Expected Result
âœ… No more console errors
âœ… Toggle works in Admin > Health Library (Manage Illnesses)
âœ… Health Library enabled by default (you can disable to test)

## What This Does
Adds a column to control whether Health Library is visible to public users:
- **Enabled** (default): Public can see Health Library
- **Disabled**: Health Library hidden from public (admin still has access)

## Test the Toggle
1. Go to: **Admin > Health Library (Manage Illnesses)**
2. Top-right corner: Look for "Public Visibility" toggle
3. Click to disable (turns gray)
4. Open site in incognito â†’ Health Library link should be gone
5. Click to enable (turns green)
6. Health Library link should reappear
