  # Fix Events System RLS Policies for Anon Role

  ## Problem
  The events system tables (events, event_images, event_videos, event_tags) were using
  Supabase Auth-style RLS policies (authenticated role, auth.uid() checks), but this
  application uses custom JWT-based authentication with the anon role.

  ## Root Cause
  - App uses custom auth middleware that validates JWTs and uses the anon role
  - Events tables had `TO authenticated` policies that don't apply to anon role users
  - Result: Authenticated admin users were blocked by RLS when trying to insert/update

  ## Solution
  Replace all events system RLS policies to use `TO anon, public` with `true` checks,
  matching the pattern established in fix-rls-policies.sql. This allows the application
  layer to handle authorization while PostgreSQL RLS remains enabled for defense-in-depth.

  ## Tables Fixed
  1. events - Main events table
  2. event_images - Event photo gallery metadata
  3. event_videos - Event video links
  4. event_tags - Event categorization/tags

  ## Security Notes
  - RLS is still enabled on all tables
  - Policies allow access to anon role (which includes custom authenticated users)
  - Authorization is enforced by the application's JWT middleware
  - Foreign key constraints still enforce referential integrity
  - Public users can still only SELECT published events (handled at app level)
