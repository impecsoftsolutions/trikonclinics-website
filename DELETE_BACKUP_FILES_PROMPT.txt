CLEANUP PROMPT - Copy and paste this entire text to Claude Code
================================================================================

I have verified that the database table deletion was successful and my website is working perfectly. I no longer need the backup files.

Please delete the following files from the project:

1. backup_tables_20251015_164928.sql
2. inspection_queries.sql
3. drop_unused_tables.sql
4. verification_queries.sql
5. DELETE_BACKUP_FILES_PROMPT.txt (this file itself)
6. .backup_timestamp (hidden timestamp file)

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE:
- Delete all 6 files listed above
- Confirm each file was deleted
- Do NOT delete any other files
- Do NOT modify any other files
- These are temporary backup files that are no longer needed

CONTEXT:
These backup files were created as a safety measure before dropping unused database tables (themes, site_settings, modern_theme_assets, modern_theme_versions). The deletion was successful, the website is functioning normally, and these backup files can now be safely removed.
