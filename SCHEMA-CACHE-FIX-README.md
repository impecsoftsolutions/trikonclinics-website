# Schema Cache Error Fix - Complete Guide

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE

**Event Save Error:** "Could not find the 'event_time' column of 'events' in the schema cache"

The event form cannot save because Supabase's PostgREST API doesn't recognize Phase 3 columns.

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Problem Identified:

1. **Phase 3 Migration Never Applied**
   - The migration file `20251014040000_add_event_form_fields.sql` exists but was never applied to the database
   - All 6 critical columns are missing from the events table
   - EventForm tries to save these fields ‚Üí API rejects them as "column does not exist"

2. **Missing Columns:**
   - ‚ùå `event_time` - Time of day when event occurs
   - ‚ùå `venue` - Location or venue name
   - ‚ùå `short_description` - Brief summary for event cards
   - ‚ùå `full_description` - Complete event details
   - ‚ùå `highlights` - Array of key event highlights
   - ‚ùå `updated_by` - User who last modified the event

3. **PostgREST Schema Cache**
   - Even if columns were added, PostgREST caches the database schema
   - Cache must be manually refreshed after schema changes
   - Without refresh, API continues to reject the new columns

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Apply Phase 3 Columns + Force Cache Reload

### Quick Fix (5 minutes):

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Navigate to your project

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Execute the Fix**
   - Open the file: `FIX-EVENT-SAVE-ERROR.sql`
   - Copy the ENTIRE contents
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click "Run"

4. **Verify Success**
   - You should see "Success. No rows returned"
   - Wait 10-15 seconds for schema cache to refresh
   - Try saving an event in the form

## üìã What the SQL Fix Does

### Step 1: Add Missing Columns
```sql
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS short_description text DEFAULT '';
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS full_description text DEFAULT '';
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS event_time time;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS venue text;
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS highlights text[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]::text[];
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS updated_by uuid;
```

### Step 2: Add Foreign Key Constraints
```sql
ALTER TABLE events
  ADD CONSTRAINT events_updated_by_fkey
  FOREIGN KEY (updated_by) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

### Step 3: Create URL Redirects Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS url_redirects (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  old_slug text NOT NULL,
  new_slug text NOT NULL,
  event_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Step 4: Add Indexes for Performance
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_updated_by ON events(updated_by);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_venue ON events(venue) WHERE venue IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_url_redirects_old_slug ON url_redirects(old_slug);
-- ... more indexes ...
```

### Step 5: Add Data Validation Constraints
```sql
ALTER TABLE events ADD CONSTRAINT venue_length_check
  CHECK (venue IS NULL OR char_length(venue) <= 200);

ALTER TABLE events ADD CONSTRAINT short_description_length_check
  CHECK (short_description IS NULL OR (char_length(short_description) >= 1 AND char_length(short_description) <= 500));

ALTER TABLE events ADD CONSTRAINT highlights_array_size_check
  CHECK (array_length(highlights, 1) IS NULL OR array_length(highlights, 1) <= 10);
```

### Step 6: Force Schema Cache Reload (CRITICAL!)
```sql
-- Update table comment to trigger schema refresh
COMMENT ON TABLE events IS 'Events table - Phase 3 columns added - Schema cache refreshed';

-- Add comments to new columns
COMMENT ON COLUMN events.event_time IS 'Time when the event occurs (optional)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN events.venue IS 'Location or venue name for the event (max 200 chars, optional)';
-- ... more comments ...

-- Send reload notification to PostgREST
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
```

## üß™ Testing After Fix

### 1. Verify Columns Exist

Run this query in SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'events'
AND column_name IN ('event_time', 'venue', 'short_description', 'full_description', 'highlights', 'updated_by')
ORDER BY column_name;
```

Expected result: All 6 columns should be listed.

### 2. Test Event Form

1. Navigate to: `/admin/events/add`
2. Fill in the form:
   - Title: "Test Event"
   - Event Date: Today's date
   - Event Time: "10:00 AM" ‚Üê NEW FIELD
   - Venue: "Main Hospital" ‚Üê NEW FIELD
   - Category: Select one or more
   - Status: Draft
   - Short Description: "Test description" ‚Üê NEW FIELD
   - Full Description: "Full test description" ‚Üê NEW FIELD
   - Add a highlight: "Test highlight" ‚Üê NEW FIELD

3. Click "Save Draft"

4. **Expected:** "Draft saved successfully" message
5. **Before Fix:** Error about 'event_time' column not found

### 3. Verify Data Saved

Run this query:
```sql
SELECT id, title, event_time, venue, short_description, full_description, highlights
FROM events
WHERE title = 'Test Event'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

You should see your test event with all fields populated.

## üìä Before vs After

### BEFORE (Broken):

```
EventForm attempts to save:
{
  title: "Test Event",
  slug: "test-event",
  event_date: "2025-10-15",
  event_time: "10:00",  ‚Üê REJECTED
  venue: "Main Hospital",  ‚Üê REJECTED
  short_description: "...",  ‚Üê REJECTED
  full_description: "...",  ‚Üê REJECTED
  highlights: ["..."],  ‚Üê REJECTED
  updated_by: "user-id"  ‚Üê REJECTED
}

Result: ‚ùå Error: "Could not find the 'event_time' column of 'events' in the schema cache"
```

### AFTER (Fixed):

```
EventForm saves successfully:
{
  title: "Test Event",
  slug: "test-event",
  event_date: "2025-10-15",
  event_time: "10:00",  ‚Üê ‚úì ACCEPTED
  venue: "Main Hospital",  ‚Üê ‚úì ACCEPTED
  short_description: "...",  ‚Üê ‚úì ACCEPTED
  full_description: "...",  ‚Üê ‚úì ACCEPTED
  highlights: ["..."],  ‚Üê ‚úì ACCEPTED
  updated_by: "user-id"  ‚Üê ‚úì ACCEPTED
}

Result: ‚úÖ "Draft saved successfully"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Schema Cache Refresh Time
- After running the SQL, PostgREST may take 10-30 seconds to refresh its schema cache
- If you still see errors immediately after running the SQL, wait 30 seconds and try again
- The `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';` command forces an immediate refresh

### Existing Events
- This fix is **backwards compatible**
- Existing events will have NULL values for new optional fields
- You can edit existing events to add the new information
- Old events continue to display correctly

### Category Dropdown Issue
- The category dropdown issue (from previous fix) is separate
- Make sure to also apply the RLS fix for tags table
- See: `FIX-CATEGORY-DROPDOWN.sql`

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting "column does not exist" error

**Solution 1:** Wait 30-60 seconds
- PostgREST may need time to refresh its schema cache
- Try saving the event again after waiting

**Solution 2:** Restart PostgREST (Supabase dashboard)
- Go to Project Settings ‚Üí API
- Click "Restart" button
- This forces an immediate schema reload

**Solution 3:** Verify columns exist
```sql
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'events'
ORDER BY column_name;
```
- Look for: event_time, venue, short_description, full_description, highlights, updated_by
- If missing, re-run the fix SQL

### Issue: Permission denied when running SQL

**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in as the project owner
- Only project owners can run DDL commands
- Team members may not have permission to alter tables

### Issue: Foreign key constraint error

**Solution:** Verify users table exists
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name = 'users';
```
- If users table doesn't exist, the updated_by foreign key will fail
- Contact support to fix database structure
