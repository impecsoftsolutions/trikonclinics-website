# Hero Variants Content Display - FIXED

## Issues Identified

### 1. HeroModern (Clinical Modern Theme)
**Problems:**
- ❌ Gap styling using string value caused rendering issues
- ❌ Buttons only showed if appointmentLink/phoneNumber existed
- ❌ Some users might not see CTA buttons

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Removed inline `gap` style, using Tailwind `gap-3` class instead
- ✅ Both CTA buttons now ALWAYS render with fallback links
- ✅ "Book Appointment" button falls back to `#book-appointment` anchor
- ✅ "Emergency Call" button falls back to `#contact` with text "Contact Us"

### 2. HeroMinimal (Apple Medical Theme)
**Problems:**
- ❌ Font-weight: 300 made text too thin and hard to read
- ❌ Description text too small (text-xl)
- ❌ CTA button only showed if appointmentLink existed
- ❌ Overly light design compromised readability

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Changed heading font-weight from 300 to 400 for better readability
- ✅ Description text increased from text-xl to text-lg with explicit font-weight: 400
- ✅ CTA button ALWAYS renders with fallback to `#book-appointment`
- ✅ Improved button styling with fixed padding (px-8 py-4)
- ✅ Description margin-bottom set to fixed `3rem` instead of dynamic value

### 3. HeroPlayful (Hims Health Theme)
**Problems:**
- ❌ Buttons only showed if appointmentLink/phoneNumber existed
- ❌ Complex padding calculations using layoutSpacing might cause issues
- ❌ Description text marginBottom using dynamic spacing

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Both CTA buttons now ALWAYS render with fallback links
- ✅ Simplified button padding from dynamic calc() to fixed `px-8 py-4`
- ✅ "Book Your Visit" button falls back to `#book-appointment`
- ✅ "Call Now" button falls back to `#contact` with text "Contact Us"
- ✅ Description text and spacing preserved (working correctly)

## Technical Improvements

1. **Button Fallbacks**: All buttons now have fallback behavior:
   ```typescript
   href={appointmentLink || '#book-appointment'}
   target={appointmentLink ? '_blank' : '_self'}
   ```

2. **Conditional Text**: Phone button shows appropriate text:
   ```typescript
   {phoneNumber ? 'Call Now' : 'Contact Us'}
   ```

3. **Readability First**: Font weights adjusted for better UX:
   - Minimal layout: Changed from 300 to 400 for readability
   - Description text: Explicit font-weight: 400

4. **Simplified Styling**: Removed complex calc() operations:
   - Before: `padding: calc(${layoutSpacing.cardPadding} * 0.75)`
   - After: `px-8 py-4` (consistent, predictable)
